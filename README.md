# Dummy GST Certificate & Invoice Printing (C Project)

🚀 **Throwback to My First Semester!**

During my **1st semester of BCA at RK University**, I built this **C project** as part of my learning journey. It allows users to generate a **dummy GST registration certificate and invoice**, utilizing basic **printf, scanf, and arithmetic operations**.

## 📌 Project Overview
This program prompts users for input, such as business details, product names, and tax percentages, and then calculates:
✅ A **formatted GST certificate**
✅ An **invoice with itemized billing**
✅ **SGST & CGST calculations** based on input tax rates
✅ The **final payable amount**
